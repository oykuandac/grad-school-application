# grad-school-application

## Description

This is a Grad School Application project which can be used in any college to take applications to the master's program. That project is built by our team with 8 members for the Software Engineering course at school. 3 types of users can register to the system: student, grad school manager, and department manager. They all have their profile pages and students can make applications, department takes student's applications and processes it, then grad school finally decides and announce the accepted and rejected students.
